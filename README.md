## Description

A responsive, form validation website created through the use of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is set to validate a set of requirements, that I have created myself, for each form field to simulate registration forms and survey forms that are abundantly found on a multitude of websites on the web. The validation is done through the use of HTML attributes and checking for regular expression patterns through JavaScript. 

#### Inspiration

With the internet being so massive now, it is no surprise that it is filled with various different types of forms; whether that be for registration, login, data entry, or even surveys. All of these forms require a variety of different types of information, with each piece of information following a variety of different criteria. This means that the ability to create forms that require the user to input information in the format that is appropriate for a form field is an essential skill for any web developer. This is where I got the idea to create a form that has a variety of different criteria/requirements for each of its form fields. 

#### Idea

I decided to create web application in the form of a form (no pun intended). This application would have a basic set of criteria that would be coded into the HTML directly using the attributes of form elements and there would also be a more sophisticated set of criteria for the username and password that would show up in an error panel once the user attempts to submit the form (which would be done using JavaScript, the Document Object Model, and regular espressions). Furthermore, the form would not submit unless all the criteria required by the form is met. 

There were 2 major reasons why I decide to split the form requirement handling between the HTML and JavaScript. One was that if each and every error message was to be displayed in the error panel, it would become very crowded; from a user experience perspective this would be horrid. The other was that using the pattern attribute with regular expressions in HTML alone simply gives the user the message, "Please match the requested format," without any detail as to what the actual format is; again, from a user experience perspective this would be horrid. By using JavaScript and the Document Object Model with regular espressions, I could insert the exact required format/criteria to the error panel. 

Overall, this project would help me develop the necessary skills that enable me to create a whole array of different types of forms that exist on the web.
