## Description

A responsive, form validation website created through the use of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is set to validate a set of requirements, that I have created myself, for each form field to simulate registration forms and survey forms that are abundantly found on a multitude of websites on the web. The validation is done through the use of HTML attributes and checking for regular expression patterns through JavaScript.
